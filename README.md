Author: Tijana

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
This interactive report explores the characteristics and performance of different brands within the three most important product categories of an online store: Smartphones, Laptops, and Tablets. The goal is to help marketing and sales teams independently investigate which brands are performing best across revenue, sales volume, user ratings, and pricing strategy.

By using clear and engaging visualizations, this notebook empowers non-technical stakeholders to quickly explore insights and make informed decisions.

ðŸ”Ž What We Will Analyze
Revenue Share by Brand
A pie chart to show how total revenue is distributed across brands.

Units Sold per Brand
A line chart that highlights the total number of units sold by each brand.

Rating Distribution by Brand
A histogram and boxplot combination to analyze how users rate products from different brands.

Price vs. Units Sold
A scatter plot to explore whether there is a relationship between product price and the number of units sold.

Each visualization provides a unique perspective that helps identify which brands dominate the market, how customers perceive their products, and how pricing impacts performance.
